# URL Shortener Using Bitly API

This Python script allows you to shorten long URLs using the Bitly API. It prompts the user to input a long URL, makes a request to the Bitly API to shorten it, and then prints the shortened URL.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python if you haven't already. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

2. Install the requests library using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

3. Obtain a Bitly API token:
    - Sign up for a Bitly account if you don't have one.
    - Generate an access token from your Bitly account settings.

4. Replace `'YOUR_BITLY_API_TOKEN'` with your actual Bitly API token in the script.

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python url_shortener.py
    ```

2. Enter the long URL when prompted.

3. The script will make a request to the Bitly API to shorten the URL and print the shortened URL if successful.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- requests library

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that your Bitly API token has the necessary permissions to shorten URLs.
- Be mindful of Bitly's API usage limits and terms of service.
