# Quiz Application with SQLite Database

This Python script implements a quiz application where questions and options are stored in an SQLite database (`quiz_questions.db`). Users can take the quiz and answer questions presented from the database. The quiz tracks the number of correct and incorrect answers and displays the results on a bar graph along with the total time taken to complete the quiz.

## Features

- **SQLite Database**: The script uses SQLite to store quiz questions and options. Upon the first run, it creates a database (`quiz_questions.db`) and populates it with sample questions.
- **User Interaction**: Users can take the quiz by answering multiple-choice questions displayed on the console.
- **Quiz Timer**: The script records the time taken by the user to complete the quiz and displays it along with the quiz results.
- **Graphical Representation**: After completing the quiz, the script generates a bar graph using `matplotlib` library, showing the number of correct and incorrect answers along with the total time taken.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- SQLite3
- matplotlib

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
   
2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python and the required libraries (`sqlite3` and `matplotlib`) installed. You can install `matplotlib` via pip:

    ```
    pip install matplotlib
    ```

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script `quiz.py` in your terminal or preferred Python environment:

    ```
    python quiz.py
    ```

4. **Take the Quiz**: Answer the questions displayed on the console by typing the letter corresponding to the correct option (A, B, C, or D).

5. **View Quiz Results**: After completing the quiz, the script will display the number of correct and incorrect answers, along with the total time taken to complete the quiz. Additionally, a bar graph will be generated showing the results.

## File Structure

- `quiz.py`: The main Python script containing the quiz application code.
- `quiz_questions.db`: SQLite database file storing quiz questions and options.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the quiz application.
