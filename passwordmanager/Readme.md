# Password Manager

Password Manager is a Python script that allows users to securely store and manage their passwords for various websites or services. It uses SQLite for database storage and cryptography libraries for password encryption.

## Features

- Securely store passwords with encryption.
- Retrieve stored passwords.
- Simple command-line interface.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (`cryptography`, `sqlite3`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script files.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/password-manager.git
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip.

    ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the `manager.py` script.

    ```bash
    python manager.py
    ```

2. Follow the prompts to perform actions such as storing passwords or retrieving passwords.

3. Enter the site name, user name, and password when prompted.

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are encrypted before storing them in the database using Fernet symmetric encryption.
- The Fernet key is derived from the user's password using PBKDF2 with a strong salt.

## Structure

- `manager.py`: The main Python script containing the password manager functionality.
- `passwords.db`: SQLite database file for storing passwords.
