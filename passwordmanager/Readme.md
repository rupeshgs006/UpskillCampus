Creating a README file for your code can provide essential information for users or collaborators to understand its purpose, how to use it, and any dependencies or requirements. Below is a basic template for a README file for your password manager script:

# Password Manager

A simple password manager implemented in Python, using SQLite for database storage and cryptography libraries for password encryption.

## Features

- Securely store passwords for different websites or services.
- Retrieve and display stored passwords.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library (`pip install cryptography`)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the script `manager.py`.
2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python manager.py
    ```

## Usage

1. When prompted, enter the site name, username, and password you want to store.
2. The password will be encrypted and stored securely in the database.
3. To retrieve stored passwords, run the script again, and it will display the stored passwords.

## Security Considerations

- The passwords are encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption.
- The Fernet key is derived from the user's password using PBKDF2 with a strong salt.
