## Features

### 1. Rename File
- Renames a file within the specified directory.
- Parameters:
  - `source_dir`: The path of the directory containing the file to be renamed.
  - `old_name`: The current name of the file.
  - `new_name`: The new name for the file.

### 2. Delete Item
- Deletes a file or folder from the specified directory.
- Parameters:
  - `directory`: The path of the directory containing the item to be deleted.
  - `item_name`: The name of the item to be deleted.

### 3. Create Folder
- Creates a new folder within the specified directory.
- Parameters:
  - `directory`: The path of the directory where the new folder will be created.
  - `folder_name`: The name of the new folder.

### 4. Create File
- Creates a new file within the specified directory.
- Parameters:
  - `directory`: The path of the directory where the new file will be created.
  - `file_name`: The name of the new file.

### 5. List All Contents
- Lists all contents (files and folders) in the specified directory.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script from the repository.

2. Import the `os` and `shutil` modules into your Python environment.

3. Import the script into your Python code.

4. Use the provided functions to perform various file and directory operations within your Python code.

Example usage:

```python
source_directory = "D:/python"

# Rename a file
rename_file(source_directory, "rupesh.py", "hello.txt")

# Delete an item (file or folder)
delete_item(source_directory, "hello.mp4")

# Create a folder
create_folder(source_directory, "hello_py")

# Create a file
create_file(source_directory,"hello.txt")

# List all contents
list_all_contents(source_directory)
```

## Note

- Ensure that you provide the correct paths and names while using the functions.
- Be cautious while using functions like `delete_item`, as it permanently deletes files or folders.
